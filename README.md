# The Weeknd

## About

The Weeknd is a place to store memories. This single-user iOS app accesses the users camera and photo library, and allows the user to select and store photos with captions. The user can view a list of all photos at the same time, or see a detail view of each individual photo.

This project was built over two days at Kode With Klossy Level 3 Camp in 2018.
